# fence

Effortless way to avoid manual extern files when doing javascript
interop from Clojurescript.

That random name is a complete mess ;)

**Fence** provides a `fence.core/+++` macro that works like `do`
special form. Wrap it around all your javascript interop forms to
transform them automatically so you don't have to add extern files
manually.

## Usage

Add `fence` to your Clojurescript project:

```cljs
[fence "0.2.0"]
```
Refer to `fence.core/+++` in your namespace:

```cljs
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that won't be renamed."
  (:require-macros [fence.core :refer [+++]]))
```

and wrap all renaming-sensitive forms inside `fence.core/+++` which
works like `do` special form.

forms that requires extern | forms that works without extern
-------------------------- | -------------------------------------------
`(. js/foo bar)`           | `(+++ (.. js/foo -bar))`
`(.-boo js/foo)`           | `(+++ (.. js/foo -boo))`
`(.bla js/foo)`            | `(+++ (.. js/foo bla))`
`(.bla js/foo x y z)`      | `(+++ (.. js/foo (bla x y z)))`

Please note `+++` use `clojure.walk` to transform all interop forms
inside its body so the following should work too:

```clj
(defn foo []
  (+++
    (.-bar js/foo)
    (.moreForms js/foo)
    (at (any (level (.execute js/foo))))))
```

## How it  works

Imagine you have this piece of Clojurescript code:

```clj
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that WILL be renamed."
  )
(.. js/something -someAttributes aMethod (anotherMethod "arg1" "arg2"))
```

without extern file(s), the above code will end up with this:

```js
something.d.b().c("arg1", "arg2");
```
which will fail to execute.

Instead of writing some extern files manually, just wrap that sensitive
form inside `fence.core/+++` like this:

```clj
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that won't be renamed."
  (:require-macros [fence.core :refer [+++]]))

(+++ (.. js/something -someAttributes aMethod (anotherMethod "arg1" "arg2")))
```
and here's (part of) the result:

```js
(function() {
  var a;
  a = something.someAttributes;
  a = a.aMethod.call(a);
  return a.anotherMethod.call(a, "arg1", "arg2");
})();
```

Never be afraid of javascript interop again! ^^

### More in-depth technical details:

`fence.core/+++` transforms all interop forms found in its body code
into `fence.core/dot` and `fence.core/..` macros (`fence` version of `.` and
`..`) which in turn will expand to `aget` forms (or `aset` in the context of field assignment).

Clojurescript forms   | Output javascript         | Optimized in :advanced mode without extern     | Optimized with extern
----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------
`(. js/foo bar)`      | `foo.bar`                 | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.a`         | `foo.bar`
`(.-boo js/foo )`     | `foo.boo`                 | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.b`         | `foo.boo`
`(.bla js/foo)`       | `foo.bla()`               | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.c()`       | `foo.bla()`
`(.bla js/foo "x" 1)` | `foo.bla("x", 1)`         | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.d("x", 1)` | `foo.bla("x", 1)`


Clojurescript forms             | Output javascript              | Optimized with/without extern
--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------
`(+++ (.. js/foo bar))`         | `foo["bar"]`                   | `foo.bar`
`(+++ (.. js/foo -boo))`        | `foo["boo"]`                   | `foo.boo`
`(+++ (.. js/foo bla))`         | `foo["bla"].call(foo)`         | `foo.bla.call(foo)`
`(+++ (.. js/foo (bla "x" 1)))` | `foo["bla"].call(foo, "x", 1)` | `foo.bla.call(foo, "x", 1)`

## FAQs

1. Why not a reader macro?
 - I definitely want to but Clojurescript doesn't provide a
 convenient, sharable way to make reader macros like Clojure with
 `data_readers.clj`.

2. Are there any performance pitfalls?
 - No. Google Closure compiler will replace string versions of
   properties to symbol versions so the final javascript will be the
   same as its counterpart using *extern* files.
